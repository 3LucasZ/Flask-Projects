# Flask-Projects
Flask Projects using the HTTP protocol. 
My other repository, with Flask Projects using websockets: https://github.com/3LucasZ/MultiplayerGames

A few (currently 2) experiments and projects.

Note before using:
- Recommended to use a virtual environment
- please have all the needed python libraries (listed on requirements.txt) installed.
- PyCharm and VSCode are best for editing and using this code.
- DB Browser for SQLite App is best for viewing the sqlite database.
